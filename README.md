# LucyTheRover
To control the Rover, a controller is designed. With the help of an Arduino UNO, a joystick with an X-axis 
and Y-axis was programmed to control the roverâ€™s mobility. A transmitter was attached to the Arduino 
board to pair with the receiver on the Rover. The transmitter with the help of an antenna was put together 
to enable radio wave communication between the remote control of the rover and the rover itself. An 
Arduino UNO Is used for the car which is connected to Receiver that receives the signal from the joystick 
transmitter circuit. An H Bridge uses the signal accordingly for the motor. IR sensor that is used for object 
detection and Gas sensor for smoke. Speaker acts as our indicator for the presence of smoke, objects in 
front of the rover, when the car is going in reverse.
